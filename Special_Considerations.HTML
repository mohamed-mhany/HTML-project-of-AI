<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-30" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Special Considerations</span></h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-31" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-32" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block">&nbsp;</div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-33" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized.&nbsp;Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as&nbsp; robots &nbsp;should be treated with the same rights as humans.</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-34" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block">&nbsp;</div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-35" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage.</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-36" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block">&nbsp;</div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-37" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect human employment. With many industries looking to&nbsp;automate certain jobs &nbsp;through the use of intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.</p>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-6" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">What Is a Trading Robot?</span></h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-7" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At the most basic level, an algorithmic trading robot is a computer code that has the ability to generate and execute buy and sell signals in financial markets. The main components of such a robot include&nbsp; entry rules &nbsp;that signal when to buy or sell, exit rules indicating when to close the current position, and&nbsp; position sizing &nbsp;rules defining the quantities to buy or sell.</p>
<p class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-15" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Algorithmic Trading Strategies</span></h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-16" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the first steps in developing an algo strategy is to reflect on some of the core traits that every algorithmic&nbsp; trading strategym &nbsp;should have. The strategy should be market prudent in that it is fundamentally sound from a market and economic standpoint. Also, the mathematical model used in developing the strategy should be based on&nbsp; sound statistical methods .</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-17" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block">&nbsp;</div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Next, determine what information your robot is aiming to capture. In order to have an automated strategy, your robot needs to be able to capture identifiable, persistent&nbsp; market inefficiencies. Algorithmic trading strategies follow a rigid set of rules that take advantage of market behavior, and the occurrence of one-time market inefficiency is not enough to build a strategy around. Further, if the cause of the market inefficiency is unidentifiable, then there will be no way to know if the success or failure of the strategy was due to chance or not.</p>
<p class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-26" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Backtesting and Optimization</span></h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-27" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"> Backtesting &nbsp;focuses on validating your trading robot, which includes checking the code to make sure it is doing what you want and understanding how the strategy performs over different time frames, asset classes, or different market conditions, especially in&nbsp; black swan &nbsp;type events such as the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-28" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block">&nbsp;</div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-29" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now that you have coded a robot that works, maximize its performance while minimizing the&nbsp; overfitting&nbsp;bias. To maximize performance, you first need to select a good performance measure that captures risk and reward elements, as well as consistency (e.g.,&nbsp; Sharpe ratio. Meanwhile, an overfitting bias occurs when your robot is too closely based on past data; such a robot will give off the illusion of high performance, but since the future never completely resembles the past, it may actually fail.</p>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-31" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Live Execution</span></h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-32" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You are now ready to begin using real money. However, aside from being prepared for the emotional ups and downs that you might experience, there are a few technical issues that need to be addressed. These issues include selecting an appropriate broker and implementing mechanisms to manage both&nbsp; market risks &nbsp;and&nbsp; operational risks, such as potential hackers and technology downtime.</p>
